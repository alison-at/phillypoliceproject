Notes:
One line of data at line 3069 was removed to make code work:
The complainant states they were involved in an auto accident. The other party involved called their boyfriend, who first arrived on location. The complainant called 911; other officers and a supervisor arrived. During that time, the complainant was made aware that the other party was assigned to the Police Academy. The officers and supervisor huddled together and spoke amongst each other. The complainant was only approached by an officer to supply their identification and insurance information. The complainant felt that the officers, and supervisor, were impartial, as they favored the other party. The complainant states that they do not trust what the report will state do to the strong presence of officers who arrived to the scene for the other party involved.",2020-11-18,11:21 AM,5809
